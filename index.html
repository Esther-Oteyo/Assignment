            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Esther, a passionate web developer with a keen eye for detail and a love for coding. With [X] years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in creating innovative, user-friendly websites and applications that stand out.</p>
            <p>My journey in web development started with a fascination for technology and design. Over the years, I have worked on a variety of projects, from small personal websites to large-scale web applications. I specialize in front-end development, but I also have a solid understanding of back-end technologies, which allows me to build full-stack solutions.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. I continually seek out opportunities to learn and grow, whether it's through online courses, workshops, or collaborating with other professionals.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me [mention any hobbies or interests, e.g., exploring new technologies, hiking, or working on personal projects]. I believe that a well-rounded life contributes to creativity and innovation in my work.</p>
